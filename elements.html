								<h2>The Only Woman in the Zoom</h2>
				
								<p>I had planned the big move to Scotland to start Codeclan in 2019. The 20’s version of “where were you during 9/11?”, I handed my notice in the week before lockdown was announced. I’d packed up my things, thrown a leaving party and was due to move into my new Edinburgh flat later that week but as quickly as I scrawled my signature on leases and loan contracts, the modern world as we knew it fell apart. The universe, or God or whoever, she laughs in the face of our plans and instead she gave us; 2020. </p>

								<p>A tipsy turvy year no doubt, a bit of backpeddling, sidestepping and some oh so generous stagnation but overall I think I needed everything she threw at me. Nothing quite as humbling as leaving a salary, house and cosy commission for living wage in a butchers and moving in with you parents. But then again, nothing quite as motivating either. So whilst I was naïve to think that deferring was wise while I “waited for this to blow over” (oh, I shed a tear to my ignorant past self), I with all said and done, I thank her. I’ve made some connections in the 22nd Cohort that I hope I will always hold onto. And whilst we’re on that reflective thought wave, here’s an account of my first experience…</p>

								<blockquote>Paint the picture: It was March 2020, toilet roll was scare and faces were naked in shops.</blockquote>

								<p>The stereotype of a software development bootcamp is a group of men, of varying ages, a mix of extraverted project managers looking for the big bucks and introverted Lord of the Rings fans who’s mothers still do their washing. We can easily picture a couple of lanky young whippersnappers walking into the Edinburgh campus, sporting the same H&M hoodies that saw them through a 4 year maths degree. A joyful puppy’s skip in their step carries them to their seats, restless to conquer the digital world, their labels of virgins and lightweights won’t hold them back now. Following a few steps behind, keen but contained, in stroll the Project Managers, the Client Services Directors and Product Owners. Smart, leather folders pressed under their arms enclose concise questions specifically designed to make sure the 20 something instructors feel the perfect balance of validation and subordination. The ‘student’ title will not be disrupting the pecking order and they punctuate that point with a click of their pens before tucking their chairs. The last of the seats sit dreading, waiting for the shy little boys hiding inside the middle aged men. Their shadows shuffle in in single file, trailed by the distinctive scent of clammy hands and Irn Bru, snorting jokes about front versus backend and spluttering derogatory comments to the iPhone users of the group. </p>

								<p>Of course these stereotypes aren’t fair, as I keep saying, nerds are the new rockstars. In a world carved by the duel of Jobs and Gates, it’s Elon Musk’s top tips to success over late nights and nose bleeds so just because today’s rockstars might be have swapped earrings for Doctor Who T-shirt’s doesn’t mean they’re not cool and controversial in their own right. This stereotype doesn’t leave a lot of room for a woman though. Squint your eyes and let your mind drift for too long and maybe a super hot Charlie’s Angels type girl pixelates into focus. A five foot nine asian girl, balancing prop, wireframe glasses on the end of her nose, glinting in the rare Scottish sun, in a skin tight black latex one piece and a constant sense of urgency that sends the nerd boys into a deep, sweaty panic. Wake up sunshine.</p>

								<p>In actuality, everyone’s pretty normal. I have heard a couple of Lord of the Rings references,  seen one or two Harry Potter wallpapers and there are definitely some people who spend more money on gaming equipment + supplies than rent but other than that, everyone is nice, funny, easy going and as far as I can tell, showers regularly without a mother’s prompt. The room is filled with open minded opinions and sprinkled with diversity, probably just on the lesser side of proportionate for the location. Oh yeah, except there are no ladies nor angels present, just me, arguably neither. The bootcamp has been running for five years now and many women have walked these corridors, discouragingly most in HR and wellness but at least a few dozen have filtered through to graduation. It makes me wonder what went wrong with this class, what isn’t appealing to one half of the market? I definitely would like to see more pink and sparkles in the banner ads (always) but I’m not sure that is what’s responsible. It is particularly surprising as the CEO is a women and a very driven one at that. Melinda pops in and out of the virtual classrooms with the sunny smile of American veneers and private healthcare. She and her suspiciously well cut hair despite covid restrictions, have an energy that screams  ‘I left the house today for something other than exercise or shopping and didn't caught’. She has carries 20 years of experience on her yoga sculptured shoulders and uses the fact she’s a woman to her advantage in a way I am yet to understand but admire with tears in my eyes. She’s a real woman and makes me look like a bra stuffing school girl, kicking stones and biting my nails. What am I missing?</p>

								<blockquote class="blockleft">Cut forward to 2021: Naked faces in public will be procesuted as indecent exposure and jeans are extinct</blockquote>

								<p>Anyway, I was missing something but secretly glad of it. The Cohort I had the pleasure, nay luxury, of joining in November, was nearly 50 50 men to women. Nearly. In the previous cohort I felt like anytime I opened my mouth I was representing all women, quite a responsibility for a bumpkin from Norwich. Oh the girl doesn’t get again, oh no the woman is talking about her feelings in stand up. So naturally, as any good woman, I kept my mouth zipped shut which as any boot-camper will know, is not good for learning. To add salt to wound, it was during the the first round of covid zoom pub quizzes and so the team would look to me for all the girly questions and to my horror, I knew them all. Bridget Jones, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, astrology, Beyonce’s children, I’m your girl. And predictably, none of the football or political. Don’t tell my dad, he’d be very disappointed. </p>

								<blockquote>They say imposter syndrome is bad, try importress. </blockquote>

								<p>But joining this much more representative class, after a year of old fashioned blue collar work and having to tell butchers on several occasions specifically what they should and should not say or do to women, I  knew that as a woman in 2021, I have just as much potential as a man, and as a person, just because I execute a perfect contour doesn’t mean I can’t execute perfect algorithms. </p>

									<h3>Before I knew art doesn't pay </h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/art1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Art had always been my passion from when i was very young so it's not surprise I enjoy making things look pretty. I knew it was unlikely to ever make a career out of painting women in skimpy clothes, the market's been saturated for centuries, which is why I never went on to study it at university but there have been few vocational tasks that have scratched that arty itch until I started coding. Gone are the days that anyone can get away with anything less than a beautiful app or website. When the bar is as high as it is, customers expect clean apps with carefully thought out colour schems, clever layouts and breathtaking adverts so I think I've finally found a way to channel my inner artiste*.

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/PhoebeOil.jpg" alt="" /></span> As illustrated** in <a href="https://codeclan.com/blog/creatives-make-good-coders/">Codeclans</a> post, maybe we creatives aren't only good for phylisophical chats and making windchimes. Abstract thought helps with conceptial design, thinking 'outside  the box' and thinking about the end product from different perspectives. I've certainly felt like my ability to close my eyes and imagine what I what I'd like to see, the same way I would before starting a painting, has inspired projects I've worked on. But reason aside, it's just fun to make things beautiful and rewarding doing it, I think that's why I enjoy react so much.
