									SOFTWARE APPLICATION PROJECTS</h1>

									<h3>CYCHO | SOLO PROJECT</h3>
								<p>
									A passion project to address the growing number of London cyclists and scooter commuters and the tedious repair process. This is a full stack app, planned out with Canva, logos in Photoshop and built using JavaScript, MongoDB, Express and React and carefully styled with CSS. Building this tested my understanding and a chance to experiment with features and tools. This app includes an interactive map, displaying markers from the database, an image uploader and I have been playing around with a Watson Assistant chatbot made with redux.

									<h3>GLASGOW MURAL TRAIL | GROUP PROJECT</h3>
								<p>
									This group project addressed the problem that the official Glasgow Mural Trail has encountered, their key feature map is not working due to changes in the Google Maps API. We agreed an interactive map is the most appealing way to display data to our personas so implemented one using leaflet.js and built a full stack using JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, and React framework. This had the functionality to search through murals with filter through any of their properties, display their locations or the map, like and hyperlink their Instagrams. We styled this with CSS, inspired by the Airbnb app and it turned out well, clear, simple, attractive.

									<h3>FIT__INIT__ | SOLO PROJECT</h3>
								<p>
									An interpretation on our project briefs, I decided that a gym app was one that resonated with me most as I have a good understanding of how I’d want it to look and feel. This app was designed to be used by a gym manager to add, update and delete trainers to classes. This is a full stack interactive app, built using Python, Flask and React and styled with CSS.

									EMPLOYMENT </h1>
									<h3>C. Lidgates | Deli Assistant | May 2020 - Present </h3>
									<p>This has been my rona role at a family run butchers in Holland park. I started as a vegan butcher (spoiler, I am no longer vegan) much to the amuesment of my family and friends, but after nearly a year with Lidgates , I can't imagine life without my carnivurous, cockney rhyming  family and the best sausage rolls in London. This has been my saving grace throughout the pandemic and throughout my bootcamp, a weekly dose of in person social interaction, butcher gossip and a reason to look away from the screen for a day. 

									This inspired our last Codeclan group project, to make a shopping app for Lidgates.

									<h3>OSR Recruitment | Recruitment Consultant | Sep 2018 - Mar 2020 </h3>
									<p>
										360 consultant role, recruiting professional in digital marketing and IT. Seeking out business opportunities through cold calls, LinkedIn and networking events, client management and retention is essential. Sourcing candidates through job boards, social platforms, events, and head hunting and vetting candidates formatting CV. My relationship with both candidates and clients was my key strength, allowing me to have stable returning business and succeed in a very competitive industry. I left OSR Recruitment as the highest billing consultant and I look forward to throwing my energy into my next opportunity.
